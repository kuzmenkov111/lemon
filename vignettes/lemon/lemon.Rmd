## Introduction

Motivation



### A brief introduction to gtable

We assume the reader is familiar with ggplot2 \citep{ggplot2},
in how it differs from R's native plotting functions and that a `ggplot` object
only *describes* the visualisation in terms of mapping between variables, geoms,
and scales.

We skip the narrative to the part when a ggplot object is to be drawn on a 
device. Here, the device may be the screen, a plot window, a file, etc.
Calling to view a ggplot object, either explicitly through `print` or `plot`, 
or through any other of the multitude of functions, ggplot2 goes through
the motions of training the object's scales on the data to finally produce a 
printable object (see function `ggplot_build` in ggplot2 package).
This object is a grob table -- a `gtable` object.

The `gtable` object \citep{gtable} is of a completely different nature than the 
`ggplot` object.
Where the `ggplot` object describes the mapping between variables, geoms, and 
scales, the `gtable` object describes which lines are drawn where. 
It does so by using 'grobs', as introduced in the package `grid` by Paul Murrel.
We will only give a brief introduction to `grob` objects, but refer to 
e.g. \citet{Zhou2010} for a more general introduction.

A `gtable` object is a hierarchical collection of `grob` and `gtable` objects,
placing them in a table-like structure. 

To understand a `gtable` object, 






## Section title in sentence case

This section may contain a figure such as Figure \ref{figure:rlogo}.

## Another section

There will likely be several sections, perhaps including code snippets, such as:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
