@article{Zhou2010,
abstract = {The increasing popularity of R is leading to an increase in its use in undergraduate courses at universities (R Development Core Team 2008). One of the strengths of R is the flexible graphics provided in its base package. However, students often run up against its limita-tions, or they find the amount of effort to create an interesting plot may be excessive. The grid package (Murrell 2005) has a wealth of graphical tools which are more accessible to such R users than many people may realize. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the main features of this package and to provide some examples to illustrate how students can have fun with this different form of plotting and to see that it can be used directly in the visualization of data.},
